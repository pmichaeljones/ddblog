<h2>Take Out an Ad in your Local Newspaper</h2>

<hr />

<p>This might seem like the most basic form of advertising, but that&rsquo;s because&hellip;it is! However, local newspapers, like Denver&rsquo;s WestWord or the Miami New Times are a great way to focus in on the younger demographic. Pay a graphic designer to make you an attractive banner advertisement, and run it for a few weeks in your local paper. Make sure to track results so you know if your ROI is good. You&rsquo;d be surprised how well old fashion advertising can still work.</p>

<h2>Use Google AdWords to Do Location-Specific Advertising in your City</h2>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://google.com/adwords">Google AdWords</a> is a great way to advertise your doggie daycare business. With the location-based advertising that AdWords lets you do, you&rsquo;ll be able to have your advertisements show only in the city where your business is located. You will most likely have to pay about $1 every time someone clicks on your Google advertising, but if every 30 clicks produces a new client, that&rsquo;s a $30 cost per acquisition. Great!</p>

<h2>Sponsor a Local Sports Team of Young Adults</h2>

<hr />

<p>This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to get cheap advertising for your doggie daycare. Go find your local 20-something sports league and offer to sponsor a team. You&rsquo;ll be required to pay for their jersies(which will have your logo and website address), and you&rsquo;ll most likely need to pay their entrance fee into the league. However, every single week, your brand will get in front of hundreds of new eyes. With many young adult couples deciding to get a pet instead of have children, these are exactly the kind of people you want to be seeing your business.</p>

<h2>Use Facebook Geo-Targeting and Like-Focusing to Find Pet Owners</h2>

<hr />

<p>As much as Facebook can be a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/elandekel/2013/01/22/facebook-pages-are-a-bad-investment-for-small-businesses/">money-suck for small businesses</a>, it also serves a great purpose. If lets you focus on people with very specific interests. Using a very small marketing budget at the start, go some geo-located advertising in your city. Focus on users that have dogs and are located within a certain radius of your zipcode. With some testing, you&rsquo;ll be able to hone in and target the exact users that you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<h2>Find Bring-Your-Dog-to-Work-Companies and Offer Them a Deal</h2>

<hr />

<p>Many newer tech companies offer their employees the ability to bring their dogs/cats to work. This is a great perk to employees and a great business opportunity for you. Contact the HR department, and tell them you&rsquo;d like to partner with them as their official doggie daycare and boarding facility. When employees head out of town, you can offer them a discount on their service(and have their employer pick up the difference.) Imagine you usually charge $40/night at your facility. You can charge the employees of Company X only $20 and have their employer pick up the remaining $20. This is a great benefit they can offer their employees and you&rsquo;ll get a ton of new business.</p>

<h2>Offer Dog Pickup and Delivery and Wrap Your Vehicle in Advertising</h2>

<hr />

<p>This advertising strategy might be better for dog boarding facilities than for doggie daycare facilities, but since <a href="https://doggiedashboard.com/">DoggieDashboard</a> works with both types of businesses, we thought we should mention it. Many pet owners are busy in the morning. The last thing they want to do is drive out of the way to your pet boarding facility. By employing a pickup and delivery driver, you can schedule to have pets picked up and dropped off at a particiular hour of the day(for a fee of course). You&rsquo;ll be able to offer needed service to your clients, and they will appreciate it with giving you long-term business and maybe even some referral business.</p>

<p>If you have the disposable income, think about <a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_EU/3MGraphics/GraphicSolutions/Applications/CarWrapping/">wrapping your pickup vehicle</a> in marketing materials. This can be a great way to get your brand in front of hundreds of eyes every day. If someone with a dog sees your van at a stoplight and sees &ldquo;Pickup and Delivery&rdquo;, they just might remember your name and call you in the future.</p>
