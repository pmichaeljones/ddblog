<h2>Take Out an Ad in your Local Newspaper</h2>

<hr />

<p>This might seem like the most basic form of advertising, but that&rsquo;s because&hellip;it is! However, local newspapers, like Denver&rsquo;s WestWord or the Miami New Times are a great way to focus in on the younger demographic. Pay a graphic designer to make you an attractive banner advertisement, and run it for a few weeks in your local paper. Make sure to track results so you know if your ROI is good. You&rsquo;d be surprised how well old fashion advertising can still work.</p>

<h2>Use Google AdWords to Do Location-Specific Advertising in your City</h2>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://google.com/adwords">Google AdWords</a> is a great way to advertise your doggie daycare business. With the location-based advertising that AdWords lets you do, you&rsquo;ll be able to have your advertisements show only in the city where your business is located. You will most likely have to pay about $1 every time someone clicks on your Google advertising, but if every 30 clicks produces a new client, that&rsquo;s a $30 cost per acquisition. Great!</p>

<h2>Sponsor a Local Sports Team of Young Adults</h2>

<hr />

<p>This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to get cheap advertising for your doggie daycare. Go find your local 20-something sports league and offer to sponsor a team. You&rsquo;ll be required to pay for their jersies(which will have your logo and website address), and you&rsquo;ll most likely need to pay their entrance fee into the league. However, every single week, your brand will get in front of hundreds of new eyes. With many young adult couples deciding to get a pet instead of have children, these are exactly the kind of people you want to be seeing your business.</p>

<h2>Use Facebook Geo-Targeting and Like-Focusing to Find Pet Owners</h2>

<hr />

<p>As much as Facebook can be a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/elandekel/2013/01/22/facebook-pages-are-a-bad-investment-for-small-businesses/">money-suck for small businesses</a>, it also serves a great purpose. If lets you focus on people with very specific interests. Using a very small marketing budget at the start, go some geo-located advertising in your city. Focus on users that have dogs and are located within a certain radius of your zipcode. With some testing, you&rsquo;ll be able to hone in and target the exact users that you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<h2>Find Bring-Your-Dog-to-Work-Companies and Offer Them a Deal</h2>

<hr />

<p>Many newer tech companies offer their employees the ability to bring their dogs/cats to work. This is a great perk to employees and a great business opportunity for you. Contact the HR department, and tell them you&rsquo;d like to partner with them as their official doggie daycare and boarding facility. When employees head out of town, you can offer them a discount on their service(and have their employer pick up the difference.) Imagine you usually charge $40/night at your facility. You can charge the employees of Company X only $20 and have their employer pick up the remaining $20. This is a great benefit they can offer their employees and you&rsquo;ll get a ton of new business.</p>

<h2>Offer Dog Pickup and Delivery and Wrap Your Vehicle in Advertising</h2>

<hr />

<p>This advertising strategy might be better for dog boarding facilities than for doggie daycare facilities, but since <a href="https://doggiedashboard.com/">DoggieDashboard</a> works with both types of businesses, we thought we should mention it. Many pet owners are busy in the morning. The last thing they want to do is drive out of the way to your pet boarding facility. By employing a pickup and delivery driver, you can schedule to have pets picked up and dropped off at a particiular hour of the day(for a fee of course). You&rsquo;ll be able to offer needed service to your clients, and they will appreciate it with giving you long-term business and maybe even some referral business.</p>

<p>If you have the disposable income, think about <a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_EU/3MGraphics/GraphicSolutions/Applications/CarWrapping/">wrapping your pickup vehicle</a> in marketing materials. This can be a great way to get your brand in front of hundreds of eyes every day. If someone with a dog sees your van at a stoplight and sees &ldquo;Pickup and Delivery&rdquo;, they just might remember your name and call you in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Running a doggie daycare is hard work. You&rsquo;ve spent hundreds of hours building your facility, getting all your business licenses and now itâ€™s time to start making some money. Luckily, we here at <a href="https://doggiedashboard.com/">DoggieDashboard</a> are here to help. Here are 5 tips for increasing the business at your doggie daycare.</p>

<h2>Offer a First Month Free Program</h2>

<hr />

<p>This might sound counter-productive to most business owners, but offering a free month is one of the best things you can do to increase your business. Most pet owners are looking for a long-term doggie daycare. They don&rsquo;t anticipate switching between numerous different doggie daycares. The switching costs are also quite high. Dog owners want to feel comfortable with the people who are taking care of their dogs. If you can get someone to sign up for a free month, and blow them away with good service, you&rsquo;re more than likely going to get a long-term doggie daycare client in return. So toughen up, take a one-month hit on your revenue, and start giving our those free month passes ASAP.</p>

<h2>Start a Refer a Friend Affiliate Deal</h2>

<hr />

<p>There&rsquo;s a very good chance that you&rsquo;re current doggie daycare clients are friends with other dog owners. That&rsquo;s just how pet owners are, they tend to stick together. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, it would be a great idea to start a <a href="http://www.biscuitsandbath.com/referrals.aspx">doggie daycare refer-a-friend program</a>. It can be as easy as giving away a free week of service for every client that your current customers refer. You&rsquo;ll build you customer base while also keeping your current customers happy by giving them a great discount for helping grow your business.</p>

<h2>Partner with Local Vet Clinics</h2>

<hr />

<p>Vet clinics are a great place to look for new clients. Most vet clinics are more than willing to refer you to their clients. It might take a bit of time to generate a relationship, but once you have a solid relationship set up, you&rsquo;ll be able to reap the benefits. Vets are one of the first places that new pet owners go, and if they&rsquo;ve got your business in their rolodex, you&rsquo;ll start getting new clients without doing any work. You might want to pay the vet clinics a referral bonus, that but that&rsquo;s an issue for a future blog post.</p>

<h2>Increase Your Doggie Daycare Service Offerings</h2>

<hr />

<p>Does your doggie daycare offer grooming? Does your doggie daycare <a href="http://www.doggyhaven.com/daycare.htm">offer in-house vet checkups</a>? Does your vet offer baths? These are all simple things that you can start including in your doggie daycare offerings. Most vets will happily do a weekly housecall to your doggie daycare facility. It&rsquo;s just a matter of having your clients sign up for the &ldquo;weekly checkups&rdquo; that you offer. You&rsquo;ll get a cut of the business that the vet charges, and your cients will be more happy as a result.</p>

<h2>Create Stronger Customer Relations with Doggie Daycare Software</h2>

<hr />

<p>Doggie daycares rely on one thing more than any other, good customer service. People are putting their dogs in your trust. If you lose that trust, your business will fail, it&rsquo;s that simple. Customer service can be the make or break for your business. Good customer service will drive more clients, bad customer service will put you out of business before you know it. A great way to increase your customer service is to use a doggie daycare software tool like <a href="https://doggiedashboard.com/">DoggieDashboard</a>. With DoggieDashboard, you can keep track of your clients, and pets, and even send emails to your clients from directly inside the app. It&rsquo;s totally free and helps you keep an open line of communication between your clients and yourself.</p>

<p>We hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed these tips to increasing your doggie daycare business. Best of luck and keep DoggieDashboard in mind for when you need a <a href="https://doggiedashboard.com/">free doggie daycare software tool</a>.</p>
