[DoggieDashboard](http://doggiedashboard.com) is one of the only free online kennel management softwares out there. We keep it free because we know that running a doggie daycare is hard work and paying a bunch of money every month for your kennel software might not be in the budget. No worries though, we have sponsors that keep DoggieDashboard up and running. If you've ever though incorporating a doggie daycare software into your pet boarding business, now is the perfect time. Here are 3 reasons why DoggieDashboard can help your business.

## Keep Track of Pet Owner Contact Information
---
If your business has 50 pets, that means you probably have somewhere around 40 owners. That's a lot of information to keep track of. With kennel management software, you'll be able to keep track of phone numbers, email addresses, and any other relevant information about the pet owner. Maybe they have to work late some nights and will be late to pick up their dog. Either way, having a way to keep owner information safe and secure is exactly what kennel management software was built for.

## Manage Pet Information and Vaccination History
---
Most dogs have little [pet information tags](http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/dog-tags-101-what-you-need-to-know-to-keep-your-pet-safe) on these days. They're great for when a pet runs away from its owner and a good samaritan finds the animal. However, those tags don't hold that much information. However, now you're in luck. By using DoggieDashboard, you're able to store as much information as you need on each pet at your business. You can keep track of vaccination history, allergies, feeding schedules, and anything else that might be of importance. No more excel spreadsheets. Now you can simply log into DoggieDashboard and have all your pet information at hand.

## Send Emails to Clients(Pet Owners)
---
Emailing clients is usually one of the most stressful aspects of running a doggie daycare. You need to remember the client's email address, and if you can't remember their email address, you need to search through your inbox for your last email from them. Not with doggie daycare management software. You simply need to select the owner's name and instantly you're able to send them an email. No more digging around for addresses, you're good to go. And the best part, when they reply to your email, it gets sent directly to your regular email inbox just like normal. Life just got a whole lot easier!
