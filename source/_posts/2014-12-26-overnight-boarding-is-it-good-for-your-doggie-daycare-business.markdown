Offering overnight boarding can be a great way for doggie daycares to increase their revenue. However, there are a few things you should think about before starting to provide overnight boarding at your dog daycare business.

## Am I(or are My Employees) Willing to be "On Call" In Case of Emergencies?
---
Most doggie daycare businesses operate from 7am until 6pm, the working hours of their clients. If you decide to offer overnight boarding at your business, you're going to need to be on-call and working for 24 hours. You won't be able to leave the business unattended while you go out for dinner, run errands, etc. You'll need to have someone at your business 24 hours a day while there are pets overnight boarding. If something happens to someone's pet and you say that no one was around to deal with the issue, you could open yourself up to a lawsuit with the pet owner for negligence.

## What is the Opportunity Cost of Providing Overnight Boarding Services?
---
This one goes in line with the first question, but think about what you're going to gain and lose by offering overnight boarding. Yes, you'll earn more money, and that's always great. However, you'll also have to deal with giving up some of your personal freedom. You won't be able to do as many things after business hours close because you'll still have dogs on your property and you'll have to deal with caring for them. It's a good idea to weigh the pros and cons(find the [opportunity cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost)) of offering overnight boarding before you start advertising your service.

## Does My Current Client Base Really Need Overnight Boarding Services?
---
Lastly, ask yourself, do you current customers ever ask for overnight boarding? If your current customers haven't ask for it, and you haven't received a lot of phone calls, you might want to second guess your choice. It might not be a worthwhile choice. If you're interested in testing the waters, offer overnight boardings one or two weekends per month. This will give you a good feel for if there is a need in your community. If there isn't a need, don't offer the service, plain and simple. Ask another daycare, like [PetSmart](http://pets.petsmart.com/services/petshotel/overnight-pet-boarding/overnight-dog-boarding/) if they'll offer a referral program when you send clients to them.
